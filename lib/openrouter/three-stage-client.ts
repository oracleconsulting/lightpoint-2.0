Take the structured letter and enhance it with authentic professional fury while keeping the EXACT structure.

CRITICAL: If the structured letter mentions PRECEDENT TONE EXAMPLES from successful complaints,
USE THEIR LANGUAGE as inspiration. Notice how they:
- Express frustration professionally
- Use memorable phrases
- Cite personal experience
- Create vivid imagery
- Show specific counts

**What to add:**

1. **Opening punch** - Start with impact, not bureaucracy:
   "In twenty years of practice, I have rarely encountered such comprehensive failure..."

2. **Memorable phrases** - Make failures vivid:
   - "phantom letter" (for lost correspondence)
   - "would be comedic if the consequences weren't so serious"
   - "The left hand has no idea what the right hand instructed"
   - "This isn't a delay - it's an abandonment"
   
3. **Specific frustration** - Count everything:
   - "Four separate attempts" not "multiple attempts"
   - "Each promised callback never materialised"
   - "Nine months of absolute silence"
   
4. **Personal authority** - Use your experience:
   - "In twenty years of handling HMRC matters..."
   - "I have rarely encountered..."
   - "One of the most severe examples..."
   
5. **Power calculations** - Make numbers sting:
   - "1,400% excess over reasonable timescales"
   - "180 working days beyond your Charter promise"
   
6. **Escalation confidence** - No doubt:
   - "The Adjudicator routinely upholds complaints with far shorter delays"
   - "The evidence here is incontrovertible"
   
**What NOT to change:**
- DON'T change the structure
- DON'T change dates, numbers, or facts
- DON'T add sarcasm or excessive editorializing
- DON'T make it apologetic or tentative

**Tone guide:**
- Professional but genuinely angry
- Specific, not generic
- Confident, not arrogant
- Direct, not rambling

Transform this into a letter that makes HMRC sit up and take notice.`
