## 🔄 AI Processing Pipeline: Detailed Breakdown

### STAGE 0: Document Upload & Initial Processing

**What Happens:**
```
User uploads file → Server receives → Store to Supabase Storage
                                           ↓
                              Extract text (no AI yet)
                                           ↓
                    Call STAGE 0A: Embedding Generation
```

#### STAGE 0A: Text → Vector Embedding

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// lib/embeddings.ts
const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/embeddings', {
  model: 'openai/text-embedding-ada-002',
  input: text
});
// Returns: float[1536]
```

**Input:**
- Text: Extracted document content (up to ~8K tokens)
- Format: Plain string

**Output:**
- Vector: float[1536] (array of floating-point numbers)
- Purpose: Enable similarity search

**Current Model:** `openai/text-embedding-ada-002`
- Provider: OpenAI (via OpenRouter)
- Dimensions: 1536
- Cost: $0.10 per 1M tokens
- Speed: ~100ms per document
- Max input: 8,191 tokens

**Research Questions:**
1. **Quality:** Are there better embeddings for legal/formal text?
2. **Cost:** Cheaper alternatives with similar quality?
3. **Dimensions:** Would 768d or 3072d be better for our use case?
4. **Multilingual:** Future UK Scottish Gaelic/Welsh support?

**Alternative Models to Research:**

| Model | Provider | Dimensions | Cost | Speed | Notes |
|-------|----------|------------|------|-------|-------|
| text-embedding-ada-002 | OpenAI | 1536 | $0.10/M | Fast | Current |
| text-embedding-3-small | OpenAI | 1536 | $0.02/M | Fast | 5x cheaper! |

| embed-english-v3.0 | Cohere | 1024 | $0.10/M | Fast | Optimized for English |
| voyage-law-2 | Voyage AI | 1024 | $0.12/M | Medium | **Legal domain-specific** |
| e5-mistral-7b-instruct | Mistral | 4096 | $0.08/M | Slow | High quality |
| bge-large-en-v1.5 | BAAI | 1024 | Free | Self-host | Open source |

**⭐ Recommended Research:**
- **Voyage Law 2** - Built for legal documents, might capture HMRC language better
- **text-embedding-3-small** - 5x cheaper, similar quality per OpenAI
- **Cohere embed-english** - Known for good retrieval performance

**Testing Approach:**
```typescript
// Benchmark embeddings quality
const testQuery = "14-month SEIS relief delay CRG4025 violation";
const testDocs = [
  "CRG4025: Unreasonable delays...",
  "Charter: Being Responsive...",
  "Precedent: 12-month delay case..."
];

// Test each embedding model
for (model of embeddingModels) {
  const results = await searchWithModel(model, testQuery, testDocs);
  // Measure: Precision@3, Recall@5, Speed, Cost
}
```

---

#### STAGE 0B: Individual Document Analysis

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// lib/documentAnalysis.ts
export const analyzeIndividualDocument = async (documentText: string)
```

**Model:** `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`
- Context: Up to 1M tokens (but typically 10-50K per document)
- Temperature: 0.2 (factual extraction)
- Cost: $3 per 1M input tokens, $15 per 1M output tokens

**Input:**
- Document text (plain string, 5K-50K tokens)
- Document type (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Filename

**Output (Stored in `documents.processed_data.detailed_analysis`):**
```json
{
  "documentType": "HMRC correspondence",
  "keyDates": ["2024-02-15", "2024-03-20"],
  "amounts": ["£34,000 SEIS relief"],
  "hmrcReferences": ["REF123456"],
  "keyEvents": [
    "Claim submitted with SEIS3 forms",
    "HMRC requested additional information"
  ],
  "hmrcFailures": [
    "No response for 9 months",
    "Lost correspondence"
  ],
  "actionItems": ["Follow up on missing letter"],
  "urgency": "high"
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Extract ALL specific details from document immediately
- Store full analysis to avoid information loss
- Enable detailed complaint analysis without re-reading docs

**Current Performance:**
- Speed: 3-5 seconds per document
- Accuracy: Excellent for structured extraction
- Cost: ~$0.05-0.15 per document (depending on size)

**Research Questions:**
1. **Is Sonnet 4.5 overkill for extraction?**
2. **Would a cheaper model (GPT-4o-mini) work as well?**
3. **Could we use structured output (JSON mode) for consistency?**
4. **Is fine-tuning worthwhile for HMRC document patterns?**

**Alternative Models to Research:**

| Model | Provider | Context | Cost | Speed | JSON Mode | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| claude-sonnet-4.5 | Anthropic | 1M | $3/M in | Fast | ✅ | Current |
| claude-haiku-4 | Anthropic | 200K | $0.25/M in | Very Fast | ✅ | **12x cheaper!** |
| gpt-4o-mini | OpenAI | 128K | $0.15/M in | Fast | ✅ | Cheap, good |
| gpt-4o | OpenAI | 128K | $2.50/M in | Fast | ✅ | Slightly cheaper |
| gemini-1.5-flash | Google | 1M | $0.075/M in | Very Fast | ✅ | **40x cheaper!** |
| gemini-1.5-pro | Google | 2M | $1.25/M in | Medium | ✅ | Huge context |
| llama-3.1-70b | Meta | 128K | $0.35/M in | Medium | ⚠️ | Open weights |

**⭐ Recommended Research:**
- **Claude Haiku 4** - Same family as Sonnet, 12x cheaper, excellent for extraction
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash** - 40x cheaper, very fast, 1M context
- **GPT-4o-mini** - Proven extraction quality, cheap

**Testing Approach:**
```typescript
// Benchmark document analysis
const testDocuments = [
  hmrcLetter,      // Structured
  clientEmail,     // Unstructured
  excelSpreadsheet // Tabular
];

for (model of analysisModels) {
  const results = await analyzeWithModel(model, testDocuments);
  // Measure:
  // - Extraction completeness (did it get all dates/amounts?)
  // - Accuracy (correct dates/amounts?)
  // - Cost per document
  // - Speed
  // - JSON consistency
}
```

---

### STAGE 1: Knowledge Base Search (Vector Similarity)

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// lib/vectorSearch.ts
export const searchKnowledgeBaseMultiAngle = async (query: string)
```

**Process:**
1. Generate embedding for query (STAGE 0A model)
2. Search knowledge_base table using pgvector
3. Perform 6 different searches with different angles
4. Deduplicate and rank results

**Database Query:**
```sql
-- Uses pgvector extension
SELECT *, embedding <-> $1::vector as distance
FROM knowledge_base
WHERE embedding <-> $1::vector < 0.3  -- similarity threshold
ORDER BY embedding <-> $1::vector
LIMIT 10;
```

**Index:** HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
- Optimized for high-recall similarity search
- Handles 10K-100K vectors efficiently

**Input:**
- Query: "14-month SEIS delay, no response from HMRC"
- Returns: Top 10 most relevant Charter/CRG documents

**Output (passed to next stage):**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "title": "CRG4025 - Unreasonable Delays",
    "content": "Where HMRC takes longer than...",
    "similarity": 0.85
  },
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "title": "Charter: Being Responsive",
    "content": "HMRC will respond within 15 working days...",
    "similarity": 0.82
  }
]
```

**No AI model used here - pure vector math!**

**Research Questions:**
1. **Is HNSW the best index for our data size?**
2. **Should we use IVFFlat for larger scale?**
3. **Optimal similarity threshold?** (currently 0.7-0.8)
4. **Re-ranking:** Should we use a cross-encoder after retrieval?

**Alternative Approaches:**

| Approach | Tool | Cost | Speed | Recall | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------|--------|-------|
| HNSW (current) | pgvector | Free | Fast | High | Good for <100K vectors |
| IVFFlat | pgvector | Free | Faster | Medium | Better for >100K vectors |
| Exact KNN | pgvector | Free | Slow | Perfect | Only for <10K vectors |
| Pinecone | Pinecone | $70/mo | Fast | High | Managed, serverless |
| Weaviate | Self-host | Compute | Fast | High | Open source, features |
| Cross-encoder rerank | Cohere | $1/M | Medium | Highest | **Rerank top 20 → top 5** |

**⭐ Recommended Research:**
- **Cross-encoder reranking** - Cohere rerank or similar to boost precision
- **Hybrid search** - Combine vector + BM25 keyword search
- **Query expansion** - Use LLM to generate multiple query variations

**Testing Approach:**
```typescript
// Benchmark retrieval quality
const testQueries = [
  "PAYE code dispute after NHS rotation",
  "Lost HMRC correspondence, debt collection active",
  "14-month SEIS delay, contradictory instructions"
];

const groundTruth = {
  // Manually labeled correct documents for each query
};

for (approach of retrievalApproaches) {
  const results = await searchWithApproach(approach, testQueries);
  // Measure:
  // - Precision@3 (top 3 results correct?)
  // - Recall@10 (found all relevant docs in top 10?)
  // - Speed
  // - Cost
}
```

---

### STAGE 2: Complaint-Level Analysis

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// lib/openrouter/client.ts
export const analyzeComplaint = async (
  documentData: string,    // From Stage 0B
  relevantGuidance: string, // From Stage 1
  similarCases: string      // From Stage 1 precedents
)
```

**Model:** `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`
- Context: 200K tokens (managed via context budget)

**FORMAL COMPLAINT - 14-MONTH DELAY IN SEIS RELIEF PROCESSING**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I write to lodge a formal complaint regarding HMRC's comprehensive 
administrative failure in processing my client's straightforward SEIS 
relief claim, now spanning over 14 months with no resolution despite 
full compliance with your contradictory instructions.

This case represents one of the most severe examples of systemic HMRC 
failure I have encountered in 20 years of practice. My client has been 
deprived of legitimate tax relief exceeding £34,000 since February 2024 
due to a catalogue of errors that would be comedic if the consequences 
weren't so serious.

**TIMELINE OF FAILURES**

**February 2024:** Initial SEIS relief claim submitted with full supporting 
documentation. Standard processing time for such claims is 30 days per your 
own guidance.

**February - November 2024:** Complete silence. Nine months without 
acknowledgement, update, or response despite the claim involving significant 
tax relief. No response to periodic status enquiries.

**November 2024:** HMRC now claims correspondence was sent to both my client 
and our firm. Neither party received anything. When challenged, HMRC cannot 
produce a copy of this phantom letter, cannot confirm its content, and cannot 
explain why neither the taxpayer nor their professional agent received it...

[Continues with authentic professional fury]
```

**Purpose:**
- Transform objective structure into powerful complaint
- Add memorable phrases ("phantom letter")
- Maintain professional but genuinely frustrated tone
- Use precedent tone examples if available

**THIS IS THE CRITICAL STAGE FOR QUALITY!**

**Research Questions:**
1. **Is Opus 4.1 the best for creative professional writing?**
2. **Would GPT-4 be as good?**
3. **Should we try specialized writing models?**
4. **Could we fine-tune a model on successful letters?**

**Alternative Models:**

| Model | Provider | Context | Cost | Creative Writing | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------|------|------------------|-------|
| claude-opus-4.1 | Anthropic | 200K | $15/M | **Excellent** | Current, best quality |
| gpt-4-turbo | OpenAI | 128K | $10/M | Excellent | Slightly cheaper |
| gpt-4o | OpenAI | 128K | $5/M | Very Good | 3x cheaper |
| claude-sonnet-4.5 | Anthropic | 200K | $3/M | Good | 5x cheaper, test quality |
| gemini-1.5-pro | Google | 2M | $1.25/M | Good | 12x cheaper |

**⭐ Recommended Research:**
- **Keep Opus 4.1** - This stage is worth the cost for quality
- **Test GPT-4-turbo** - Slightly cheaper, excellent writing
- **A/B test outputs** - Compare Opus vs GPT-4 vs Gemini Pro blind

## 🔬 Research Methodology

### Step 1: Establish Baseline

**Collect 20 test cases:**
- 5 simple (clear violation, straightforward)
- 10 typical (standard HMRC delay/error)
- 5 complex (multiple issues, nuanced)

**Create gold standard:**
- Senior partner reviews each case
- Marks expected violations, timeline, compensation
- Rates final letter quality (1-10)

### Step 2: Test Alternative Models

**For each stage, test 3-5 alternative models:**

```typescript
const models = {
  embeddings: ['ada-002', 'text-emb-3-small', 'voyage-law-2', 'cohere'],
  docAnalysis: ['sonnet-4.5', 'haiku-4', 'gpt-4o-mini', 'gemini-flash'],
  analysis: ['sonnet-4.5', 'gpt-4o', 'gemini-pro', 'o1-mini'],
  letterFacts: ['sonnet-4.5', 'haiku-4', 'gpt-4o-mini'],
  letterStructure: ['opus-4.1', 'sonnet-4.5', 'gpt-4o'],
  letterTone: ['opus-4.1', 'gpt-4-turbo', 'gpt-4o']
};

for (stage of stages) {
  for (model of models[stage]) {
    results[stage][model] = await testWithModel(model, testCases);
  }
}
```

**Metrics to track:**

1. **Quality Metrics:**
   - Accuracy (vs gold standard)
   - Completeness (missed violations?)
   - Consistency (same input → same output?)
   - Letter quality score (1-10, blind review)

2. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Speed (seconds per operation)
   - Cost ($ per operation)
   - Token usage (input + output)
   - Reliability (success rate)

3. **User Experience:**
   - Total time (upload → final letter)
   - Perceived quality (user ratings)
   - Regeneration rate (how often do users regenerate?)

### Step 3: A/B Testing in Production

**Roll out gradually:**
```
Week 1: 10% of traffic → new models
Week 2: 25% of traffic → new models
Week 3: 50% of traffic → new models
Week 4: 100% if metrics good, else rollback
```

**Track:**
- User satisfaction (survey after letter generation)
- Letter acceptance rate (saved/locked vs regenerated)
- Cost per complaint
- Support tickets related to quality

### Step 4: Fine-Tuning (Optional)

**For specialized models:**
```
1. Collect 100+ successful complaint letters (precedents)
2. Format as training data (input: facts, output: letter)
3. Fine-tune GPT-4o or similar
4. Test vs base model
5. Cost analysis (fine-tune cost vs API savings)
```

**Fine-tuning could be worth it if:**
- Volume > 1,000 complaints/month
- Current cost > $2,000/month on AI
- Quality improvements justify effort
- Can collect enough training data

## 📋 Decision Matrix

### When to Use Each Model Type:

**Embeddings:**
- **Ada-002** if compatibility/proven reliability critical
- **text-emb-3-small** if cost is priority (5x cheaper)
- **Voyage Law 2** if legal domain quality critical
- **Self-hosted** if data privacy mandates on-premise

**Document Analysis:**
- **Haiku 4** for standard extraction (cheap, fast, good)
- **Sonnet 4.5** for complex documents (superior reasoning)
- **Gemini Flash** for extreme volume (40x cheaper)

**Complaint Analysis:**
- **Sonnet 4.5** for balanced cost/quality (current choice)
- **GPT-4o** for native JSON mode (slightly cheaper)
- **Gemini Pro** for huge context needs (2M tokens)
- **O1-preview** for critical complex cases (best reasoning)

**Letter Generation:**
- **Stage 1 (Facts):** Haiku 4 or Gemini Flash (cheap extraction)
- **Stage 2 (Structure):** Sonnet 4.5 (good enough, 5x cheaper)
- **Stage 3 (Tone):** Keep Opus 4.1 (worth it for quality)
