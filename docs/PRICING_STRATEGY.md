## 📊 **Feature Distribution Rationale**

### **Why AI Generation is in ALL tiers:**
- This is the core value prop
- Reduces barrier to entry
- Gets users hooked on the platform
- Differentiates from competitors

### **Why Precedent Search is Pro+:**
- High-value feature for experienced practitioners
- Creates upgrade incentive
- Significant backend costs (vector search)
- Power users will happily pay

### **Why White-Label is Pro+:**
- Critical for firms wanting to maintain brand consistency
- Strong upgrade driver
- Signals professional/enterprise positioning

### **Why API is Enterprise only:**
- Very few will need it
- High support/maintenance cost
- Justifies premium pricing
- Creates enterprise tier distinction

---

## 💡 **Pricing Psychology Applied**

### **1. Anchoring Effect**
- Enterprise at £999 makes Professional at £299 feel reasonable
- Professional becomes the "Goldilocks" option

### **2. Value Perception**
- Per-complaint cost decreases with higher tiers
- Clear feature ladder encourages upgrades

### **3. Psychological Barriers**
- £99 is under the £100 psychological threshold
- £299 feels significantly less than £300
- £999 rounds nicely for enterprise budgets

### **4. Annual Discount**
- 2 months free (16.67% off) is standard SaaS pricing
- Encourages annual commitment
- Improves cash flow

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Modifications** (Optional)

### **Option A: Add "Essentials" Tier at £49/month**
**Pros:**
- Lower barrier to entry
- Catches budget-conscious solos
- More customers = more word of mouth

**Cons:**
- May cannibalize Starter tier
- More support burden for less revenue
- Could cheapen brand perception

**Features:**
- 2 complaints/month
- Templates only (no AI generation)
- Self-service support

### **Option B: Remove Starter, Start at £199**
**Pros:**
- Premium positioning
- Higher average revenue per user
- Better customer quality

**Cons:**
- Reduces total addressable market
- Harder to acquire first customers
- Competitive disadvantage vs. free/cheap options

### **Option C: Usage-Based Pricing for Enterprise**
**Example:** £999 base + £25 per complaint over 30

**Pros:**
- Aligns cost with usage
- More attractive for variable-volume practices

**Cons:**
- Harder to predict revenue
- More complex billing
- Psychological impact of "per-use" charging
